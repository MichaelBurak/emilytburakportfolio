# **Projects**

## Current Projects:

### _Lords of War: An Arms Trade Analysis_

![alt text](lowcap.png)

- Work in progress Python-based data analysis of historical global arms trade data from [SIPRI](https://www.sipri.org/databases/armstransfers) using Neo4j as a graph database for tricky heavily relationship-driven rich text format data focusing on supply dynamics. Utilizing clustering with t-SNE/UMAP, outlier detection, and NLP on comments on the trades. Future work includes adding more synergistic data and machine learning modeling with a focus on the Cold War. [(Repo)](https://github.com/MichaelBurak/arms-trade-analysis)
